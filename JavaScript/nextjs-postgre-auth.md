## Section 1: Introduction

#### 1. Introduction

In this course, we will use `Next.js` with `Postgre` as a database to create a financial tracking App, called NextCash.

We will use `clerk` to allow user to sign up or log in to this application.

User log-in enables Google account.

To store the data, we use Postgre hosted in `Neon`, and `Drizzle ORM` to interact with it.

For the UI, we will use `Shadcn UI`, so, `Tailwind CSS` will also be used.
